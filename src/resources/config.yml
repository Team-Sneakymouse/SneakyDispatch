##The dispatch-cap represents the maximum amount of paladins that we want to see at a scene
#This is visible to the players. Without proper permissions, it will be enforced.
##The dispatch-par represents the minimal amount of paladins that we want to see at a scene
#This is not visible to players. It is used behind the scenes to judge whether the paladins are spread too thin
