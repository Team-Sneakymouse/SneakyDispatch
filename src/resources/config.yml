##The amount of minutes between mechanical dispatches
#The mechanical dispatch is checked every minutes
#It only triggers if the amount of paladins who haven't been dispatched in {paladin-idle-timer} mins is more than the open slots in ongoing emergencies
#(ignoring paladins who logged in less than {paladin-idle-timer} mins ago)
#This cooldown is also triggered if an emergency expires without meeting its dispatch par, since this implies that they are spread too thin
paladin-idle-timer: 20
mechanical-dispatch-cooldown: 20

##The icon that is shown in the dispatch menu when an emergency has reached its cap
cap-icon-material: "red_wool"
cap-icon-custom-model-data: 0

##The dispatch-cap represents the maximum amount of paladins that we want to see at a scene
#This is visible to the players. Without proper permissions, it will be enforced.
##The dispatch-par represents the minimal amount of paladins that we want to see at a scene
#This is not visible to players. It is used behind the scenes to judge whether the paladins are spread too thin
##The descriptions support placeholder replacement. They use the reporting player for replacements, and are only parsed at the moment of reporting
